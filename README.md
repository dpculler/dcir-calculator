# dcir-calculator
This Python script was written to simplify data collection at an old job. The script takes in an xlsx file, picks out the 4 data points of interest, and performs an Ohm's Law calculation to find the DC internal resistance (DCIR) of the device under test. The results are output into another xlsx file, and the operation is performed on any other data files in the directory.
